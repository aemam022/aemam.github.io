## Analysis

# Graph analysis

In this section, we observe different statistics of our big graph. This preliminary analysis helps us to understand the properties of the graph and therefore get to know how to explore it.

### General properties

Let's start by the number of nodes and edges:
- Nodes: 118824
- Edges: 374240

First thing to notice, the graph is very sparse:
- Sparsity = $\frac{|E|}{|E_{max}|}$ =  0.01%

![\Large Sparsity=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}) 



As we want to do clustering, we take a look at the connected components.
- There are 4 connected components
- There are 3 small connected components (size 10, 13 and 13)
- There is on big connected componenents of 118788 speakers

It looks like we can not rely on connected components only.

### Degree

Who are the main speakers of our graph ? Are people very connected ? Let's figure this out !

![png](Graph_analysis/output_8_0.png)
    
![png](Graph_analysis/output_8_1.png)
    
Most of the speakers have very low degrees, but some have very high degree.
Indeed the degree distribution is following a **power-law**, which is typical for real world networks.

Who are those very famous people ?

- Donald Trump is linked to 2570 people
- Narendra Modi is linked to 812 people
- Emmanuel Macron is linked to 752 people
- Nancy Pelosi is linked to 733 people
- Mike Pompeo is linked to 718 people
- Boris Johnson is linked to 692 people
- Andrew Cuomo is linked to 690 people
- Benjamin Netanyahu is linked to 669 people
- António Guterres is linked to 646 people
- Justin Trudeau is linked to 620 people
    

The Top 10 central speakers in our graph are very famous country leaders.
We could have expected this, especially that Donald Trump is the most central.

### Clustering

Are there obvious and interpretable clusters ?

We use Louvain clustering method to check either we can identify interpretable cluster:
- the partition results of 543 clusters

It's a too large number for us to interpret each group by hand, we then focuse on attributes.

### Homophily
Which speaker attributes could be useful to filter on ? We compute the homophily with respect to *gender*, *nationality* and *political party*.

The homopholy estimate the similarity of connections in the graph with respect to the given attribute. 

Results of homopholy:
- gender: 0.225
- nationality: 0.404
- party: 0.321

Those results show that *nationality* is a good attribute to observe clusters. Indeed on the 3D graph we clearly distinguish clusters of speakers with the same nationality.


## Case Study 1: Investigating Sportwashing Bipartite Analysis 

## Filtering over time

We thought that it could have been interesting to observe the evolution of our graph over time. We focus on a specific example : *2018 Football World Cup*. Our idea is that politicians might me speaking more about sport during big events like this. 

Then we investigate whether politicians are more connected with sportsmen in summer 2018 compared to summer 2017 and 2019. We build a bipartite graph between politicians and sportsmen for each year.

### Summer 2017

![png](Filter_bipartite/output_2_0.png)
    
Number of edges: 163

    Mark Roche is linked to 29 people
    Konrad Hurrell is linked to 24 people
    Annastacia Palaszczuk is linked to 24 people
    Graham Annesley is linked to 24 people
    Chris Reykdal is linked to 18 people
    

### Summer 2018

![png](Filter_bipartite/output_6_0.png)
    
Number of edges: 227

    Alex Hawke is linked to 51 people
    Peter FitzSimons is linked to 51 people
    Becky Wood is linked to 46 people
    Andrew Constance is linked to 46 people
    Shane Buckley is linked to 40 people
    

### Summer 2019

![png](Filter_bipartite/output_10_0.png)

Number of edges: 151

    Dick Moriarty is linked to 32 people
    Grant Shapps is linked to 32 people
    Israel Folau is linked to 26 people
    Penny Wong is linked to 20 people
    Peter FitzSimons is linked to 16 people
    
### Summary

If we look at the graph and the weighted number of edges, the connections of the graph are stronger during summer 2018.
The number of crossing edges is:
- 2017: 163
- 2018: 227
- 2019: 151

However when we observe the names, sportsmen quoted a lot are retired athletes, mostly ex-rugbymen. In the end we don't observe a lot of football names. 

Therefore we cannot really conclude on our statement "politicians talk more about sportsmen during World Cup". In fact, a politician might talk about a sportsmen in an article, but nothing implies that this sportsmen will be quoted in the same article. A graph based on mutual mention in quotes may have worked better (see annex).
