<p>In this project, we are going to analyze data from an experiment about <em>honesty</em>. 
Oftentimes, we are asked to confirm our honest intentions by signing <strong>at the end</strong> of a document. 
For example, in tax returns or insurance policy forms, we are often asked to sign our names under a text that reads 
something like “I hereby certify that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.”</p>
