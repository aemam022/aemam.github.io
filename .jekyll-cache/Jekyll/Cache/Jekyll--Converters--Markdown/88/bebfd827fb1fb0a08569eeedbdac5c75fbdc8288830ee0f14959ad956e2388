<h2 id="filtering-over-time">Filtering over time</h2>

<p>We thought that it could have been interesting to observe the evolution of our graph over time. We focus on a specific example : <em>2018 Football World Cup</em>. Our idea is that politicians might me speaking more about sport during big events like this.</p>

<p>Then we investigate whether politicians are more connected with sportsmen in summer 2018 compared to summer 2017 and 2019. We build a bipartite graph between politicians and sportsmen for each year.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>If we look at the graph and the weighted number of edges, the connections of the graph are stronger during summer 2018.
The number of crossing edges is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2017: 163</li>
  <li>2018: 227</li>
  <li>2019: 151</li>
</ul>

<p>However when we observe the names, sportsmen quoted a lot are retired athletes, mostly ex-rugbymen. In the end we don‚Äôt observe a lot of football names.</p>

<p>Therefore we cannot really conclude on our statement ‚Äúpoliticians talk more about sportsmen during World Cup‚Äù. In fact, a politician might talk about a sportsmen in an article, but nothing implies that this sportsmen will be quoted in the same article. A graph based on mutual mention in quotes may have worked better (see annex).</p>
