<h2 id="graph-analysis">Graph Analysis</h2>

<p>In this section, we observe different statistics of our big graph. This preliminary analysis helps us to understand the properties of the graph and therefore get to know how to explore it.</p>

<h3 id="general-properties">General properties</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s start by the number of nodes and edges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nodes: 118824</li>
  <li>Edges: 374240</li>
</ul>

<p>First thing to notice, the graph is very sparse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Sparsity = $$ \frac{</td>
          <td>E</td>
          <td>}{</td>
          <td>E_{max}</td>
          <td>}$ =  0.01%$$</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As we want to do clustering, we take a look at the connected components.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are 4 connected components</li>
  <li>There are 3 small connected components (size 10, 13 and 13)</li>
  <li>There is on big connected componenents of 118788 speakers</li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like we can not rely on connected components only.</p>

<h3 id="degree">Degree</h3>

<p>Who are the main speakers of our graph ? Are people very connected ? Letâ€™s figure this out !</p>

<p><img src="Graph_analysis/output_8_0.png" alt="png" /></p>

<p><img src="Graph_analysis/output_8_1.png" alt="png" /></p>

<p>Most of the speakers have very low degrees, but some have very high degree.
Indeed the degree distribution is following a <strong>power-law</strong>, which is typical for real world networks.</p>

<p>Who are those very famous people ?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Donald Trump is linked to 2570 people</li>
  <li>Narendra Modi is linked to 812 people</li>
  <li>Emmanuel Macron is linked to 752 people</li>
  <li>Nancy Pelosi is linked to 733 people</li>
  <li>Mike Pompeo is linked to 718 people</li>
  <li>Boris Johnson is linked to 692 people</li>
  <li>Andrew Cuomo is linked to 690 people</li>
  <li>Benjamin Netanyahu is linked to 669 people</li>
  <li>AntÃ³nio Guterres is linked to 646 people</li>
  <li>Justin Trudeau is linked to 620 people</li>
</ul>

<p>The Top 10 central speakers in our graph are very famous country leaders.
We could have expected this, especially that Donald Trump is the most central.</p>

<h3 id="clustering">Clustering</h3>

<p>Are there obvious and interpretable clusters ?</p>

<p>We use Louvain clustering method to check either we can identify interpretable cluster:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the partition results of 543 clusters</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s a too large number for us to interpret each group by hand, we then focuse on attributes.</p>

<h3 id="homophily">Homophily</h3>
<p>Which speaker attributes could be useful to filter on ? We compute the homophily with respect to <em>gender</em>, <em>nationality</em> and <em>political party</em>.</p>

<p>The homopholy estimate the similarity of connections in the graph with respect to the given attribute.</p>

<p>Results of homopholy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>gender: 0.225</li>
  <li>nationality: 0.404</li>
  <li>party: 0.321</li>
</ul>

<p>Those results show that <em>nationality</em> is a good attribute to observe clusters. Indeed on the 3D graph we clearly distinguish clusters of speakers with the same nationality.</p>
